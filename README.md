Abstract: Duality arguments suggest that the superconducting phase transition should belong to the same
universality class as the 3D XY model with an inverted temperature axis, such that the disordered
phase of the XY model maps onto the normal phase of a superconductor. However, over the
years, experiments and numerical studies have failed to conclusively confirm this relationship.
This paper studies the simplified case of a “frozen superconductor”, which can be shown to be
exactly dual to the three-dimensional XY model. We derive the Landau theory for the 3D XY
model to demonstrate the technique in practice. We then study the Wolff Monte Carlo clustering
algorithm, to observe the KT phase transition at the critical temperature of the 2D XY model.
We then extend the algorithm to the 3D case, whose observables are crucial for demonstrating the
duality between the FZS and XY models.

This project contains all the source code and testing notebooks for the above paper topic. The XY2D and XY3D files contain class definitions for the 2D and 3D Wolff clustering algorithms.
